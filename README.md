🚀 Welcome to my little corner of the coding universe! I’m Dave, a **full-stack engineer** with a passion for launching creative and powerful web apps into the digital galaxy.

🌎 I’m currently working on [DishSwap](https://github.com/PenneconDavid/DishSwap) — a recipe-sharing platform with an **anime-inspired UI** and a focus on connecting home chefs through delicious food.

### 🚀 About Me

- 💼 Bootcamp Grad: I'm taking the coding bootcamp road to level up my dev skills!
- 🔭 Exploring the cosmos of full-stack development using **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and more.
- 🎨 Obsessed with bringing creativity into code—whether that’s fun **UI/UX** designs or interesting **projects**.
- 🌱 Learning **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and all the cool modern frameworks you can think of.
- 🍣 I'm also a big fan of food and travel—catch me in Japan trying all the sushi!
